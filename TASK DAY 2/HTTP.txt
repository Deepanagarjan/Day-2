Difference between HTTP /1.1 vs HTTP/2

HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
1.It is used in client-server communication.
2.By using HTTP, send the request to the server and the server sends response to the user.

HTTP/ 1.1:
*HTTP/1.1 which created in 1997.
*HTTP/1.1 Works on the textual format.
*MULTIPLE TEXTING: HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other , There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
*SERVER PUSH:the connection was not lost here after the first request because we add a keep-alive header which is the part of the request so there is an open connection between the server & client. there is a persistent connection which means several requests & responses are merged in a single connection.
*HEADER COMPRESSION: It compresses data by itself.
PRIORITIZATION:It doesn't have a mechanism for prioritizing requestes.

HTTP/2:
*It works on the binary protocol.
*It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
*It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
*It uses HPACK for data compression.
